_Note:_ 

- this is an experimental version that puts the statsd on a zeromq pub/sub mechanism
- is patched for version 6. of node

Requires npm module zmq : <https://github.com/JustinTulloss/zeromq.node>
+ zmq bindings for your OS

    $ npm install zmq

Additional settings:

- zmqAddress: publisher bind address
- zmqPort : publisher port

A sample subscriber is included as subscriber.js

    $ node subscriber.js

    $ echo "somecounter:1|c" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125

==================================

StatsD
======

A network daemon for aggregating statistics (counters and timers), rolling them up, then sending them to [graphite][graphite].

We ([Etsy][etsy]) [blogged][blog post] about how it works and why we created it.


Concepts
--------

* *buckets*
  Each stat is in it's own "bucket". They are not predefined anywhere. Buckets can be named anything that will translate to Graphite (periods make folders, etc)

* *values*
  Each stat will have a value. How it is interpreted depends on modifiers

* *flush*
  After the flush interval timeout (default 10 seconds), stats are munged and sent over to Graphite.

Counting
--------

    gorets:1|c

This is a simple counter. Add 1 to the "gorets" bucket. It stays in memory until the flush interval `config.flushInterval`.


Timing
------

    glork:320|ms

The glork took 320ms to complete this time. StatsD figures out 90th percentile, average (mean), lower and upper bounds for the flush interval.  The percentile threshold can be tweaked with `config.percentThreshold`.

Sampling
--------

    gorets:1|c|@0.1

Tells StatsD that this counter is being sent sampled every 1/10th of the time.

Debugging
---------

There are additional config variables available for debugging:

* `debug` - log exceptions and periodically print out information on counters and timers
* `debugInterval` - interval for printing out information on counters and timers
* `dumpMessages` - print debug info on incoming messages

For more information, check the `exampleConfig.js`.

Guts
----

* [UDP][udp]
  Client libraries use UDP to send information to the StatsD daemon.

* [NodeJS][node]
* [Graphite][graphite]

Graphite uses "schemas" to define the different round robin datasets it houses (analogous to RRAs in rrdtool). Here's what Etsy is using for the stats databases:

    [stats]
    priority = 110
    pattern = ^stats\..*
    retentions = 10:2160,60:10080,600:262974

That translates to:

* 6 hours of 10 second data (what we consider "near-realtime")
* 1 week of 1 minute data
* 5 years of 10 minute data

This has been a good tradeoff so far between size-of-file (round robin databases are fixed size) and data we care about. Each "stats" database is about 3.2 megs with these retentions.

TCP Stats Interface
-------------------

A really simple TCP management interface is available by default on port 8126 or overriden in the configuration file. Inspired by the memcache stats approach this can be used to monitor a live statsd server.  You can interact with the management server by telnetting to port 8126, the following commands are available:

* stats - some stats about the running server
* counters - a dump of all the current counters
* timers - a dump of the current timers

The stats output currently will give you:

* uptime: the number of seconds elapsed since statsd started
* graphite.last_flush: the number of seconds elapsed since the last successful flush to graphite
* graphite.last_exception: the number of seconds elapsed since the last exception thrown whilst flushing to graphite
* messages.last_msg_seen: the number of elapsed seconds since statsd received a message
* messages.bad_lines_seen: the number of bad lines seen since startup

Installation and Configuration
------------------------------

 * Install node.js
 * Clone the project
 * Create a config file from exampleConfig.js and put it somewhere
 * Start the Daemon:

    node stats.js /path/to/config


Inspiration
-----------

StatsD was inspired (heavily) by the project (of the same name) at Flickr. Here's a post where Cal Henderson described it in depth:
[Counting and timing](http://code.flickr.com/blog/2008/10/27/counting-timing/). Cal re-released the code recently: [Perl StatsD](https://github.com/iamcal/Flickr-StatsD)
